### Introducing how computers work
- Input -> CPU, Memory -> Output
- Software controls hardware. 

### What makes a computer, a computer
- Input: the user interface that is the medium of input of information (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, gaming controller). 
- Processing: the computer processes information using CPU and memory by running algorithms, which are a series of commands. 
- Output: the final result of what the user wants to see as a response. 
- Computers do all this for us! A computer is to the mind what a bicycle is to a human. 

### Binary and data
- Computers ultimately work in binary: 1's and 0's. 
- Humans almost never directly work in 1's and 0's. 
- Operations, commands, and algorithms use 1's and 0's to process input. 
- A wire can be in an on or off state, to respectively represent 1 or 0. A bit represents the wire. 
- A series of wires together can represent a number in decimal or hexadecimal. These numbers can be operated on by other numbers. Letters, words, images, movies, soundwaves, and much more are ultimately represented by these wires. 

### Circuits and logic
- Circuits output a signal dependent on other signals inputted. 
- A "not" circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it
- More complicated circuits take multiple signals at a gate, and combine them to give different results. 
- Examples of logic gates: and, nand, not, nor, or, xor, adder, 8 bit adder, subtractor, multiplier, and much more
