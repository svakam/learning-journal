# Markdown

For headings, list 1-6 #'s (hashes) before your text, then a space after the hash. 
# Headings:
## Heading #
### Smaller heading ##
#### Even smaller heading ###

## Styling:
**Bold** Use ** before and after text, no spaces between hashes. 

*Italic* Use * before and after text, no spaces between hashes. 

~~Strikethrough~~ Use ~~ before and after text, no spaces between hashes. 

**Bold _and italicize_ within** Same as bold, but an underscore surrounding italicized text within bold formatting. 

Unordered listing: 1 dash and a space before text

Regular numbered listing before text (number order does NOT matter: Markdown will continue to ascend numbering regardless of number input)

Add dash and a space before nested items. For nested items, the dash must be at least right below or after the first character of the text it's being nested under. 
Nested list: 
- Nesting
  - Listing
    - More listing

For task listing, add a dash, space, and a set of brackets with a space between. To mark the item as done, replace the space between the brackets with an x.

Use a backtick surrounding a text that should be quoted within unquoted text. 

- This is a `quote`, so voila!

Use a greater-than sign and a space to add a separate line of quotation text. 

- Quoting text: Steve Jobs once said, 

  - > Stay hungry, stay foolish.
