### My definition of growth mindset:
> Having a **mentality of positive progression and improvement of yourself over time, _regardless_ of your standing and knowledge.**

### Three reminders of how I will keep myself in a growth mindset:
1. Remember to appreciate those who understand the material better than yourself at the moment, and don't be afraid to ask for help. 
   - Don't be intimidated! 
2. Understand the big picture and main goals of what the current assignment/task at hand is. 
   - Make sure to do this if you're stuck for too long! 
     - And if you're stuck, remember to take a break now and then. 
3. Instead of saying "I won't learn this", remember to add a ***yet*** to the end of that sentiment.
