# Vik's Learning Journal

## Intro to Vik
Hello! My name is Vik Akam. I am 25, and I am a graduate of the UW Class of 2016 with a BS in Biochemistry. I am currently in the works of applying to medical school, but I also have a passion for computers and understanding the CS industry much more. As an alterative to a career in medicine, I hope to become a software developer and perhaps return to the medical industry to contribute my future knowledge of programming and project management. If not the medical industry, I wish to pursue my passion for music, or perhaps work for a software company or startup. 

Today I will learn:
- markdown
- Growth Mindset
- Sandbox Learning

### My definition of growth mindset:
> Having a **mentality of positive progression and improvement of yourself over time, _regardless_ of your standing and knowledge.**

### Three reminders of how I will keep myself in a growth mindset:
1. Remember to appreciate those who understand the material better than yourself at the moment, and don't be afraid to ask for help. 
- Don't be intimidated! 
2. Understand the big picture and main goals of what the current assignment/task at hand is. 
- Make sure to do this if you're stuck for too long! 
 - And if you're stuck, remember to take a break now and then. 
3. Instead of saying "I won't learn this", remember to add a ***yet*** to the end of that sentiment.
