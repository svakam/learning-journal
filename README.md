# Vik's Learning Journal

## Intro to Vik
Hello! My name is Vik Akam. I am 25, and I am a graduate of the UW Class of 2016 with a BS in Biochemistry. I am currently in the works of applying to medical school, but I also have a passion for computers and understanding the CS industry much more. As an alterative to a career in medicine, I hope to become a software developer and perhaps return to the medical industry to contribute my future knowledge of programming and project management. If not the medical industry, I wish to pursue my passion for music, or perhaps work for a software company or startup.
