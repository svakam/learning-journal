## Version control

**Version control:** a system that allows revisiting of different versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. 

Can revert a file or project to previous version/track modifications/modifying individuals/comparing changes

By utilizing a VCS (Version Control System), mistakes can be more efficiently corrected

#### Local vs centralized vs distributed VCS

**Local VCS:** one database on local hard disk that stores changes to files

**Centralized VCS:** single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by different clients. Eliminated need to involve all local databases and have more active involvement across programmers
