### Why it's important for devs to be thoughtful about their selection 

If you don't enjoy using a text editor, then why use it? It's important to choose one that has an enjoyable UI and experience for you. 

Features of text editors: 
1. Code completion
- Displays possible suggestions based on user typing
- Ex. Emmet (HTML, CSS efficiency)
2. Syntax highlighting
- Highlights types of code for easier analysis and proofreading
3. A variety of themes (reduce strain, fatigue)
- Dark background, brightly colored text is preferred
4. Ability to choose from a selection of extensions
- 'Plugins' that allow you to customize your experience as you grow with the text editor

# The Command Line

A command line (terminal) is a text-based interface to the system. Enter commands to a given prompt by typing them out and computer feedback will be outputted as text. 

### Opening a terminal

Every system is different (Windows vs Mac vs Linux). 

### The Shell, Bash

A shell defines how the terminal will behave and look after running commands. The most common one is called **bash**, which stands for Bourne again shell. 

### Shortcuts

Linux has plenty of shortcuts, which stop things like silly mistakes. 

# Basic Nagivation

**pwd** : print working directory (prints out what directory you're in
**ls** : lists what is in the directory
**ls -l** : long listing (gives more complex info about directory)

### Paths

Absolute vs. relative paths: Understand that file system under Linux is a hierarchical structure. AT the top is the **root** directory. Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root, and relative paths specify a location in relation to current location in system (will not begin with a slash). 

### Change directory

`cd [location]`

# Files

Understand that everything is a file under the hood. File extensions (.exe, .txt, .png) are 2-4 characters. Linux is case sensitive for files and file types. Keep in mind spaces in file/directory names (use quotes to surround an entire item). Files may be hidden (use `-a` to display hidden files as a command-line argument).
